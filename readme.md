RESN is a JavaScript stack for making extremely scalable web apps. This repository is very much a work in progress and mostly just a sandbox. Ideally it would serve as a scaffolding comprised of technologies that focus on scalability and ease of use.

RESN is split into three components, client, server, and data.
